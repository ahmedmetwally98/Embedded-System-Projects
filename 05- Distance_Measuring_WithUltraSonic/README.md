# Distance Measuring using Ultrasonic Sensor

- Developing a system that measures the distance using ultrasonic sensor and display it on LCD.


### Mainly there are three layers, which are:
- Application Layer contains: Application.
- Hardware Abstraction Layer contains: LCD, Ultrasonic modules.
- Micro-controller Abstraction Layer contains: GPIO, ICU, and Interrupt modules.

> - Project developed using Eclipse IDE and simulated on Proteus.
> - Micro-controller: ATmega16.
