# Embedded System Projects

In this Repo, there are some embedded projects, which i have done during my journy in learning embedded systems development to demonstrate my skills in developing embedded systems.

All projects are implemented using 8-bit micro-controller.

## Projects overview

1. Traffic light on Demand, develeoped using ATmega16 micro-controller.
2. Digital clock and stopwatch system, developed using PIC18F4620 micro-controller.
3. Simple calculator, developed using ATmega16 micro-controller.
4. Temperature coltrols fan speed developed using ATmega16 micro-controller.
5. Measuring Distance using ultrasnoic sensor developed using ATmega16 micro-controller..
6. Door lock security system developed using ATmega16 micro-controller.

> Projects based on ATmega micro-controller are developed using Eclipse IDE.
> Projects based on PIC micro-controller developed using MPLAB X IDE.

All projects are implemented based on Layered Archeticture Design.
Mainly there are three layers, which are:
- Application Layer, where application was developed.
- Hardware Abstraction Layer, where sensors and actuators were developed.
- Micro-controller Abstraction Layer, where hardware drivers were developed.
